# Charles' Homelab
## Introduction
The purpose of creating this respository is to store scripts that are used in my homelab environment and document everything that I've done to keep track of my learning progress.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
The scripts that I created are used for testing/demonstration purposes only. Please do not use these script on a production environment.
